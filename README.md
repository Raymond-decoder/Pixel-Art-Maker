# Pixel-Art-Maker
This is a simple online pixel art editor to help you make pixel art easily. Pixel Art Maker (PAM) is designed for beginners, and pros who just want to whip something up and share it with friends. If you like making pixel art, and need an online drawing app like this, then hopefully it lives up to your expectations.

## Instructions

To get started with the web app, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.
Also open the `styles.css` to add styles and colors to the web app and finally the `index.html` for laying out the html building blocks.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students for the ALCwitheGOOGLE scolarship program for 2018. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Live_Page
Please follow this [link](https://raymond-decoder.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/) to visit the github page for the pixel art maker. To test and review the live page for the **Pixel Art Maker** please click [here](https://raymond-decoder.github.io/Pixel-Art-Maker/).

## New_Functionality
I also added some few functionalities like _**Remove Grid**_ and _**Clear Color**_ Buttons. The _**Remove Grid**_ will remove the whole grid should incase the user wants to remove all the grid without making use of the _**submit**_ button- which clears and draw new grid. The _**Clear Color**_ button will clear the whole color in the grid. This is used when the user wants to clear the old color/art on the grid or to draw new pixel art. Forcing the user to achieve this by clicking on the cells one at a time is stressfull, not recomended and as well not a great user experience (UX) and so I added the functionality for the task.
**Note:** the user can still click on a cell to clear the color on that very cell should incase a user makes a _**minor**_ mistake while painting on the grid.

## Slack_Handle
My _**slack handle**_ for the [ALC with Google 3.0](alcwithgoogle3.slack.com) is [@Raymond (fe - team - 405)](https://alcwithgoogle3.slack.com). 

## Experience
I acquired a lot of experience during the training on Udacity and more during the project. Not only have I learnt how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript and jQuery but I also believe that I can now build an interactive web page. 

## Appreciation
Special thanks goes to [Google](www.google.com), [ALC](https://andela.com), and [Udacity](www.udacity.com) and my team mates on the slack channel for giving me such a wonderful opportunity to learn _**Frontend Web Development**_. This little that I know now has really given my career a new shape of great hope. Thank you so much. You guys are the best. Hopefully believing to make it to the _**Second Phase (NanoDegree)**_ of the scholarship. 

Thanks Team!
